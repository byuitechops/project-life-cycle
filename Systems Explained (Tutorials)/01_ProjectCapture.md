# 01 Project Capture

## Purpose and Overview

This is the first stage of the project. In fact, this is the stage that gets the initial objective and requirements for the project. The associated output document is the [Project Capture Document](../01_ProjectCaptureDoc.md)

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours

- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

You are at this stage because an idea was decided important enough to potentially become a project. This is the process of gathering information that will enable us to eventually determine if the project is technologically plausible and if the ROI of the project is worth the effort.

1. Set up meeting with the stakeholder(s) from whom you will be gathering the information.

1. At the meeting fill out the [Project Capture Document](../01_ProjectCaptureDoc.md)

1. At the end of the meeting do the following:

    a. Go over everything in the document start to end (a sort of end to end explanation and check to make sure there is nothing we are missing or misunderstanding).

    b. Review Expectations    
    - There are no promises we will be able to actually do the project until research phase is over. We will be researching this to determine if it is possible and will have a return on investment, and we will let you know what we find.
    - 
    c. Set next meeting
    - On the spot, make sure a meeting is set and put it on the outlook calendar.

    d. Review Action Items before next meeting
    - Make sure that the stakeholder knows what things he/she needs to do, and let them know if those items are roadblocks to progression of any portion of the project, so they are aware that we will not be able to do our part if they do not do theirs.
