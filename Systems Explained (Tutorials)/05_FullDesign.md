# 03 Full Design

> Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file. - Louis Srygley

## Purpose and Overview

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

Developers should anticipate that their design will change after conversations with more senior developers. They should approach the approval process with a "How can my design be better?" attitude.

## Tutorial of Process

1. Determine if the project is an emergency or a smaller project to see if this stage should be skipped or not

1. Using the project capture document and stakeholder interaction create an SRS

1. Starting from the seed of the Key Components Document create an SDD

1. Set up project using a set of templates (could use Yeoman or existing C# frameworks that have templates).  Need more or less the following:

    - README
    - Code Templates for unit tests
    - Code Templates for main function
    - Code Templates for input/output
    - Other Code Templates
    - License File (e.g. MIT)
    - Package.json
    - Any other files we will need as part of the project template out and ready boilerplate style.

1. Using generated templates add comments and stubbed code throughout

- Can also include comments and stubbed code for tests.

1. Set up meeting with manager/leads to get your full design approved before official development starts.
