# 06 Closing

Closing the project is very straight forward. It's as easy as 1-2-3. Follow these steps:

1. Documentation Check
1. Maintenance Plan
1. Lessons Learned Reported

## Purpose and Overview

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*


## Tutorial of Process

1. Documentation Check
    
    Ensure all documentation is in place (all of it should be, and this is just a check).

1. Maintenance Plan

    Determine with your manager/leads whether a formal maintenance plan document is necessary or if a word of mouth plan will suffice. Answer some of the questions below.

    How long will this application be alive and how long will we maintain it? Who in the office will be the developer contact for this application (if bugs arise. This most likely will be the developer who created the application, but long term plans should be made to determine who will be the owner of the application in semesters to come.
    
1. Lessons Learned Reported

    Message your manager and leads what you learned and/or what changes you would make personally or to the office based on what you learned (lessons learned).
