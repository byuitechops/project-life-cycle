# 03 Learning

## Purpose and Overview

The purpose of the learning phase is to answer the following questions:

1. Can it be done? (Is this possible?)
1. Can YOU do it? (Do you have the skills you need?)
1. Should we do it? (Is the ROI worth it?)
1. What will the timeline be?
1. How will we break up this project into deliverables? (What will the completion cycle be?)

### Deliverables
The deliverable from this phase is defined in the Key Components Doc. It will be a custom deliverable that will be created per project in order to help answer the questions above.

### Time Estimate: Set Per Project
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

This phase is very simple. Follow the instructions which were approved in the Key Components Doc. When your prototypes/research/tutorials are completed, you are ready to complete the requirements and design.
