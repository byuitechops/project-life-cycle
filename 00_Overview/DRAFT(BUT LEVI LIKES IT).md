# Only 4 Stages Only 3 Documents

## 1. Capture

- Would include the project capture doc
- The project capture doc would include all requirements
- On a per project basis leads/Josh would determine how detailed the requirements will need to be, but they would be a part of the same document

## 2. Design

- Key Components Doc
- The key components doc would include all designs. It would start small and then grow as needed.  All design artifacts would be tied to this doc.
- Like the project capture doc, leads/Josh would help determine how fleshed out the designs need to be.

## 3. Code

- Stub out the code then commit as version say, 0.1.0 or something like that using Emma's build code which will be included in every project in the templates (yeoman).
- Code out the design.

## 4. Deliver

- Create a Tutorial style readme that includes links to all other project documents.
- Deliver the completed project.


## Additional Ideas:

- (We could build a githook or a script into our yeoman with a command such as "next" that would update the version add, commit, push and email Josh/leads notifying them that the next stage is starting).
- There would be 3 approvals, but I think we ought to continue working onto the next stage while waiting for a meeting with leads/Josh.
- The approvals would be this 1->capture doc, 2-> components doc, 3-> finish product and readMe. You could say there is 4 approvals if you include the stakeholder approval of the product. Unless we wanted to include the stubbed out code as an approval. 
- I think the approval process should not be a "You can't go forward until you get approval", but more of a "lets get guidance at major points, so that we do the least amount of refactoring possible".
