# Overview Recap

## Project Request (*Capture*)
^ Assign Project to Person \
^^ Produce Project Capture Doc \
^^^ Approval of Capture Doc "Is this doc up to snuff"

## Understand The Problem + How to Solve ((*Design*))
while (!approved) {
^ Produce the Key Components Doc \
^^ Learning Proposal for things that are needed to learn, time expectations (not an artifact) \
^^^ GetApproval (You, Josh, KeyComponentsDoc, LearningProposal) \
}

## Learning Phase ((*Code*))
while  ( (!Learned && !TimesUp) || !DeliverableCreated) { \
   Learned = LearnFromPeer(Employee, Topic); \
   Learned = LearnFromInternet(); \
   Learned = LearnFromMakingPrototypes(); \
   DeliverableCreated = MakeDeliverable(); \
   Learned = LearnFromJosh(); \
}
