# 06 Development and Testing

> "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie

## Purpose and Overview

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours
- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

1. Put system of sprints and/or junior/senior developers etc. here.

1. Additionally add a system of how do you know when a requirement has been met in development?

    - It may be that the best way to handle this is to create a test that checks all the parts of the requirement. Then the developer would develop the function/task to pass the test.  (In industry this is called test driven development).
