# 01 Project Capture

## Purpose and Overview

This is the first stage of the project. In fact, this is the stage that gets the initial objective and requirements for the project.

### Deliverables
1. Project Capture Document [template](../01_ProjectCaptureDoc.md)

### Time Estimate: 1-3 hours

- *Depending on the project and knowledge of the developer, the time estimate may differ.*

## Tutorial of Process

You are at this stage because an idea was decided important enough to potentially become a project. This is the process of gathering information that will enable us to eventually determine if the project is technologically plausible and if the ROI of the project is worth the effort.

1. Set up meeting with the stakeholder(s) from whom you will be gathering the information.

1. At the meeting, fill out the Project Capture Document deliverable.

1. At the end of the meeting, do the following:

    a. Go over everything in the document start to end (make sure there is nothing we are missing or misunderstanding).

    b. Review Expectations    
    - There are no promises we will be able to actually do the project until research phase is over. We will be researching this to determine if it is possible and will have a return on investment, and we will let you know what we find.
   
    c. Set next meeting
    - On the spot, make sure a meeting is set and put it on the outlook calendar. Typically a week later depending on the project (for more urgent projects, one or two days).

    d. Review Action Items before next meeting
    - Create two lists:
		1. Things that we will do
		1. Things that the stakeholder(s) will do
			- Be sure to include things that will hinder our progression, for example, they will email us a list of courses to act on


### Best Case:

1. Josh receives a request for work and sets up a meeting.
1. Josh, a student and the stakeholder meet together and fill out Project Capture Doc on the spot.
1. Project Capture Doc is approved by a Lead
1. Leads/Josh determines who will do the project
    
### Worst Case:

1. Josh mentally captures a project from a stakeholder. (A student could gather this information, but only if they make it clear to the stakeholder that the project must be approved by Josh.
1. Josh meets with a student next to a computer and while Josh shares the project, the student fills out the capture doc. (The student in this meeting will most likely be the student who is assigned to the project.)
1. Project Capture Doc is approved by a Lead.
1. If the project was not assigned to the student who created the project capture doc, Josh/Leads will assign the project at this time.
